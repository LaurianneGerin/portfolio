          Iâ€™m a creative mind with a background in marine biology, passionate about building interfaces and solving customer experience problems.<br/>After graduating I spent a year figuring out what to do with my professional life. My dream has always been to work at Pixar. I'm constantly fascinated by the level of detail and caring this company puts into creating animated movies. My search lead me to pivot and start a career as a front-end engineer. For 3 years this experience brought me closer to the tech industry and incrementally brought me closer to what I was passionate about: Building visuals to trigger an emotional response.
          <br/>Teaching and sharing are two values Iâ€™ve always cared about. Hence I joined Algolia as a sales engineer for a year and as a developer educator for another year. Finally I was given the chance to move to product design in March 2022.
          <br/>This website aggregates a few of my contributions over the past years both as a CSS passionate and a junior designer. Hope you will enjoy it as much as I did creating it.
