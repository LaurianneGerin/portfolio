          <b>I thought I would become an Oceanographer.</b> At 18, the only thing I loved studying was any topics related to the ocean. I learned every different aspect of the ocean possible: chemistry of the ocean water, geology, physical movements of the water and any marine life form.
          I had a blast for 5 years and graduated the University of Pierre and Marie Curie (UPMC Paris Sorbonne) with a masterâ€™s degree. But quickly I had to think about how to make a living with all that knowledge. The obvious next step was to go for a thesis but thatâ€™s not what I wanted.

          At the end of 2015, I took a year off to travel. I did not go too far, taking advantage of my dual citizenship (French/American), I joined a friend who was studying an entrepreneurial program at Berkeley, California. Thatâ€™s when I discovered the tech world, joining meet-ups, meeting developers, designers. I had so many questions!
          I found myself helping my friend on a very basic website for their semesterâ€™s pitch contest. How hard could it be compared to oceanography modelling (Matlab) or biology stats (R)? I learned HTML, JS and CSS as well as softwares such as Photoshop and Sketch. I had so much fun, I couldnâ€™t stop learning.

          When I came back to France, I knew selling a self-taught experience would be difficult. Nonetheless, under a year, I managed to reorient my path and start as a junior web developer in 2016.
          Eversince, I learned a lot as a Front-end developer and I am now looking to expend my skills in product design.
