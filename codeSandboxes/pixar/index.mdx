## Pixar SparkShorts

“The SparkShorts program is designed to discover new storytellers, explore new storytelling techniques, and experiment with new production workflows.
These films are unlike anything we’ve ever done at Pixar, providing an opportunity to unlock the potential of individual artists and their inventive filmmaking approaches on a smaller scale than our normal fare.” 
Jim Morris - President, Pixar Animation Studios

Those Pixar shorts, to me, resembles what hackathon are to developers. An opportunity to play with a creative idea and a group of diverse people with diverse skills during a short but intense period of time.
Often the results are surprising.
I am passionate about Pixar and I enjoy looking at those short animations, trying to see the details in every spot, character, background, lighting. How did they succeed to share strong emotions on such a small movie?
Notice the "eye" of the robots? Their emotions are shared with geometrical shapes!

In this one, titled Smash and Grab, the LEDs used on the chest of the robots to illustrate their energy level caught my eye. I thought it looked really cool, so I tried to replicate it with CSS.
With more time, I would even have animated it and used it as a loading experience.
